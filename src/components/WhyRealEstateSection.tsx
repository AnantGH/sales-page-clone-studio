            People ask me "Why Real Estate?"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-semibold text-white italic">
            "Real Estate is so old-school people earn money through Crypto, SMMA, Dropshipping, trading etc. nowadays"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-semibold text-white italic">

          </p>
          
          <p>
            Notice the world around if there is any building near you, then that is real estate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So you see every skyscraper or farmhouse is owned by someone,
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            This means as long as humanity is alive we will keep making buildings and that is why real estate is evergreen.

          <p>
            But the same cannot be said for other business models.
